# ParliamentDebateTopics
...detects topics and topic changes in German parliamentary debates and relates them to taz articles.
For now, only the matrix representation of the debates has been implemented.

Run MatrixBuilder to have a look at the term-document, tf.idf and svd matrices.

You can choose between hardcoding your xml file directory or giving the directory as argument to the MatrxiBuilder. Uncomment the respective lines for FILE_DIR and filesDir accordingly.
